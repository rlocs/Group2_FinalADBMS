A Digital Approach to Barangay Healthcare: Optimizing Accessibility and Efficiency for Sustainable Community Well-being (Aligned with SDG 3 For Good Health and Well-being ) Many barangay health centers still rely on manual processes, leading to inefficiencies in managing healthcare services. This project aims to modernize these centers by developing a digital system that improves efficiency, accessibility, and convenience for both healthcare workers and residents. Key features include an interactive dashboard, patient record management, appointment scheduling, and household profile tracking. The system enables healthcare workers to efficiently manage records and appointments, while residents benefit from reduced wait times and better coordination. Overall, the project enhances operational efficiency and strengthens community health care delivery.
